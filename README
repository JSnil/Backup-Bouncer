About
=====

This is a framework for systematically testing backup tools in OS X.  It
contains a suite of tests to verify that metadata has survived a copy operation,
along with a suite of copiers.  It will even automatically prepare disk images
as source/destination targets for you.

Be aware that this program is not terribly polished, so if you're not willing to look at the source

Prerequisites
=============

In order to examine/set Finder metadata attributes, the following utilities are
required:

* SetFile
* GetFileInfo

These are included with the XCode developer tools, and backup-test expects them
to be in /Developer/Tools.  If they're not there for some reason, add their
location to your PATH and all will be well.

Installation
============

1. run "make"
2. there's no step 2.

You can now run "backup-test" with no arguments for usage info.  Or, you can run
"./autopilot" to automatically generate some disk images, run all tests, and see
the results.

History
=======

This work was inspired by the plasticsfuture blog post[1] on the (rather sad)
state of OS X backup tools.  The post was an extremely valuable contribution in
many ways, but it was particularly helpful for simply enumerating all (?) of the
many and varied metadata attributes of a modern Mac HFS+ volume.  However,
despite requests from myself and others, maurits neglected to release his test
suite to the public.

The topic of backup fidelity became important to me personally as the hard drive
in my powerbook started dying the death of a thousand bad blocks.  So I set out
to reproduce maurits' results and run some extra tests of my own.
