CTOOL INSTALLATION

  1. Building
     --------

    ctool is designed only for Mac OS X.  The supplied Makefile
    should work just fine.  There is no installation script.  Given
    the nature of the application, such an option probably would not
    be used much.  Copy it to /usr/local/bin if you like.
        
  2. Development History
     -------------------
  
        v0.9 - 25 Feb 2003 - First edition.
        v1.0 - 21 Apr 2003 - Second release edition.
